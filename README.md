# Liquidity Tracker

## Goal
We were charged by Lassing to develop this over 1,5 yrs ago and lets just say we failed. It wasn't good and we barely had the tech savyness to make it good but that wouldve been manageable. We barely understood the use case.

The overarching goal with this is to launch it and make it awesome.

But the short term goal, the MVP so to say, is to have it replace our google sheets liquidity tracker. That's step nr 1

## TODOs

1. Make a frontend MVP with mock data, that functions perfectly as a replacement of our google sheets liq-tracker
2. Develop a backend to power the frontend. One workspace, one login, shared workspace.
3. Use it for 1-2 months and polish it
4. Make a backend with users and workspaces and shared workspaces
5. Think about auxiliary functions and sign on more members
